# SSIS-Data-Warehouse-ETL-Pipeline
This project showcases an end-to-end ETL pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads data from an OLTP database into a star schema data warehouse.  To efficiently track changes, an incremental load mechanism is built, and business reporting is done using a Power BI dashboard.
